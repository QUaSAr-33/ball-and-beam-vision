# Control Strategy

## Overview
The system uses a **PID controller** to keep the ball near the center of the beam.

**Signal Flow:**
Webcam (ball position) → Python Script (PID) → Serial → Arduino → Servo Motor → Beam

## Controller
- **Input:** Error = Desired position (center) – Measured position
- **Output:** Servo angle
- **Control Law:**
\[
u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int e(t) dt + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
\]

## Tuning
- Initial tuning was performed in Simulink using a linearized model.
- Final fine-tuning was done experimentally on the physical system.
